* Barely 7 seconds into the game here, Minnesota are in control of the ball and majority territory in their half. 
But one under-hit pass plus a quick transition, and Orlando are in despite vastly inferior spatial control in the Minnesota half. 
* The Voronei diagram is used to indicate spatial control. 
* The goal is to achieve high spatial control in the attacking third, and have  rest defense in the right position to deal with transitions even if 
the spatial control might seem high defensively.
